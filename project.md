The 2025 edition of the course **CS-E4740 - Federated Learning** includes a student project. 
You are free to choose an application of **federated learning (FL)**. The goal is to **formulate 
the application as an instance of generalized total variation (GTV) minimization over an FL network**.

FL networks and GTV minimization will be introduced as core mathematical structures for 
studying FL during the course [lectures]({{ site.baseurl }}/) and in the [course book](https://github.com/alexjungaalto/FederatedLearning/blob/main/material/FLBook.pdf).


## Project Requirements

- **Choose an FL application** relevant to your interests.
- **Design and analyze FL algorithms** from the course to address your chosen application.
- **Write a project report** using the provided template [tex](https://github.com/FederatedLearningAalto/FederatedLearningAalto.github.io/blob/master/project/ReportTemplate_25.tex) ([pdf](https://github.com/FederatedLearningAalto/FederatedLearningAalto.github.io/blob/master/project/ReportTemplate_25.pdf)).
- **Submit your report by April 30, 2025**.
- **Peer-review other students' reports until May 15, 2025**. Current draft for review sheet [pdf](https://github.com/FederatedLearningAalto/FederatedLearningAalto.github.io/blob/master/project/ReviewSheet.pdf)
- **Submit a revised report and response letter by May 31, 2025**.

## Ground Rules

As a student in this course, you must adhere to the **[Aalto University Code of Conduct](https://www.aalto.fi/en/aalto-university/code-of-conduct-values-into-practice).** The two key principles for this project are:

### Rule I - Be Honest
- **Plagiarism is strictly forbidden** â€“ cite any sources you use.
- **Randomly selected students may be asked to explain their work (including peer grading).**

### Rule II - Be Respectful
- The course aims to provide a **safe and enjoyable learning environment**.
- Any **disrespectful behaviour** (including on course communication platforms) will be **strictly sanctioned** and reported to university authorities.

## Example Applications of FL

FL is used in various domains, including:

- **Healthcare** (e.g., personalized medical models)
- **Finance** (e.g., fraud detection and risk assessment)
- **Smart grids** (e.g., optimizing energy distribution)
- **Mobile networks** (e.g., predicting network congestion)
- **Autonomous vehicles** (e.g., improving self-driving models)
- **Cybersecurity** (e.g., detecting network anomalies)

### FL in Healthcare
Federated Learning can **enable smartphones to become personal healthcare advisors** by training models using local and public health data.

**Key Reference:**  
Rieke, N., et al. *The future of digital health with federated learning.* *Nature Medicine, 2020.*

### FL in Finance
Federated Learning can improve **fraud detection** and **credit risk assessment** in financial institutions.

- **Fraud detection:** Aurna, N. F., et al. *Federated Learning-Based Credit Card Fraud Detection.* (2023)  
- **Risk assessment:** Li, W., et al. *Personal Credit Evaluation Model Based on Federated Learning.* (2024)

### FL at the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI)
- FL models can be trained **individually for each FMI weather station** to make local predictions.
- **Python script for retrieving FMI data:** [click me](https://github.com/FederatedLearningAalto/FederatedLearningAalto.github.io/blob/master/assets/DemoIntroLecture/Lec_FLNetworksUtils.py)

### FL for Finnish Road Safety
- Train **local models for traffic cameras** to predict congestion and accidents.
- **Python script for retrieving camera snapshots:** [click me](https://github.com/FederatedLearningAalto/FederatedLearningAalto.github.io/blob/master/assets/DemoIntroLecture/GetDataFinTraffic.py)

## The Growing Role of FL in IoT
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a **massive, global FL system** where billions of devices communicate to improve **efficiency and automation**.
As IoT networks grow, **federated learning will play a critical role** in enabling **decentralized intelligence**.

### Ready to Start?
- **Pick your FL application.**
- **Formulate your problem as a GTV minimization task.**
- **Experiment with FL algorithms from the course.**
- **Submit your findings and improve through peer review.**

Good luck with your project!
