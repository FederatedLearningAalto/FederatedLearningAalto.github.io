\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	{\bf Instructions (Remove before submission).} Font-size must not be smaller than 9 points. The report cannot be longer 
	than 5 pages, including everything: abstract, all 6 sections of the report, and figures. 
	The 5th page should contain only the references section.
	\begin{abstract}
		{\bf Instructions (Remove before submission).} This abstract provides a concise summary of the project, including the FL 
		application, empirical graph modeling, variation minimization approach, and 
		the FL algorithms used.
	\end{abstract}
	
	\textbf{Keywords:} Federated learning, networks, personalized machine learning, trustworthy artificial intelligence
	
	\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:intro}
	{\bf Instructions (Remove before submission).}
		Introduce the background and motivation for your FL project:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A real-life scenario motivating your FL application.
			\item Summary of state-of-the-art methods relevant to your project.
			\item Brief outline of the structure of your report.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Problem Formulation}
	\label{sec:pf}
	{\bf Instructions (Remove before submission).}
		Model your FL application as an FL network (see \cite[Ch.~3]{Jung2025}). 
		In particular, clearly define and explain:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Nodes: What real-world devices do they represent?
			\item Local Models: Describe the ML models used at each node.
			\item Loss Functions: Specify local loss functions used at each node.
			\item Edges: How are edges and their weights chosen? See \cite[Ch. 7]{Jung2025} for 
			data-driven methods to choose the edges of an FL network. 
		\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Methods}
	\label{sec:methods}
{\bf Instructions (Remove before submission).}
	The project requires you to apply GTVMin-based methods to 
	the FL application modelled in Section \ref{sec:pf}. In this section 
	you need to clearly state and explain:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Your choice of variation measure, e.g., $\phi(\mathbf{w}^{(i)}-\mathbf{w}^{(i')})$ 
			for parametric models. 
			\item Your choice of FL algorithm (i.e., optimization method for solving 
			GTVMin) and its message passing implementation.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Numerical Experiments}
	\label{sec:experiments}
	{\bf Instructions (Remove before submission).}
	Discuss the following.  
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Data sources used. One example of such a source is the Finnish meteorological institute \url{https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data}. 
			\item Model validation, selection, and diagnosis methods (see \cite[Sec.~6.6]{Jung2022}).
			\item Training, validation, and test losses for each node of the FL network. 
		\end{itemize}
	

\textbf{Important:} Your submission must include a zip archive containing a single 
Python script along with any necessary data files. Minimize the use of non-standard 
Python packages to ensure ease of execution and reproducibility.

	
	\section{Conclusion}
	\label{sec:conclusion}
	{\bf Instructions (Remove before submission).}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Discuss whether the obtained results solve the problem satisfactorily.
			\item Identify limitations and suggest potential improvements.
		\end{itemize}
